## This is a simple guide and introduction to using github on your huntington laptop

### Step 1 - Installation and Start up

1. Open Software Center. Download and install `Git for Windows`, `Visual Studioi Code`
2. Once complete, you should see a Git folder in your Program files. Searching in windows, you should find **Git Bash**, **Git CMD**, and **Git GUI**
3. **Open Git Bash**

> Note this a Unix/Linux shell and will not accpet Windows Commands. Linux cheatsheet can be found [here](http://cheatsheetworld.com/programming/unix-linux-cheat-sheet/).

4. Inside of your shell, you will be in root PC folder `U:\`. 
5. Run the command `git`. You should see a list of help commands. This confirms you have git installed and ready to use.

> You are likely to run into a few issues while intializing your first repo.

### Step 2 - Create Git Hub Account & Repository

1. Go to [Github.com](https://github.com), and create an account if you don't have one.
2. After login, create a new repo. 
3. Name it `SeviceNowHuntingtonDemo` and hit Create repository

You now have an empty repository. We will start using git commands in the next step.
